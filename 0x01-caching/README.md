# 0x01. Caching

## A caching system is a component used in computer systems to store and manage frequently accessed data or resources in a fast and easily accessible location. The primary goal of a caching system is to improve the overall performance and response time of the system by reducing the need to access slower, distant, or more resource-intensive data storage.
